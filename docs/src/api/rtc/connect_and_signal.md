# Connect

Connect to the real-time connection and signal.
The method isn't available for `none` backend.

Creates a Janus handle for the particular agent.

If there's already a stream present for the RTC then the returned handle would be bound to the
Janus instance that hosts this stream.

If there's no stream yet then the handle is being balanced to the instance with the least number
of active RTC streams.
